# Multi-Outcome Event Prediction Library Applications





Note that the model can't predict strings as they are variable lenth, 
you should instead predict enums which will be one hot encoded.





## Social Media Platforms

### Instagram Example

**Event Types:**
```
Open App
  duration_spent : float

Create post
  number_of_photos : int
  number_of_videos : int
  caption_length : int
  hashtag_count : int

Like
  is_account_following_user : bool

Comment
  comment_length : int
  comment_sentiment : float
  reply_to_comment : bool

Share_post
  share_platform : enum
  add_personal_message : bool

Delete_account
  reason_privacy : bool
  reason_mental_health : bool
  reason_time_waste : bool
  reason_content_quality : bool
```

**Use Case:**
A social media platform wanting to predict user engagement patterns and account retention might analyze how different interaction sequences affect the likelihood of various outcomes.

**Example Analysis:**
- Users who like posts from accounts they follow are 23% less likely to delete their account
- Users who create posts with 3+ photos have 45% higher probability of receiving comments
- Comment sentiment below 0.3 increases probability of account deletion by 12%
- Users who reply to comments (reply_to_comment = true) rather then directly to posts (reply_to_comment = false) may be using the app as more of a discussion or argument platform, and so have different behaviour.

**Testing Sequences:**
```
Open App -> Like { is_account_following_user: true } 
Open App -> Like { is_account_following_user: false }
```

The model would predict different probabilities for subsequent outcomes like `Create_post`, `Delete_account`, etc.

## Medical Outcomes Prediction

### Healthcare Event Modeling

**Event Types:**
```
Surgery
  surgery_type : enum
  duration_hours : float
  anesthesia_type : enum
  surgeon_experience_years : int

Post_surgery_complication
  complication_type : enum
  severity_score : float
  days_post_surgery : int
  requires_intervention : bool

Recovery_milestone
  milestone_type : enum
  days_to_achieve : int
  pain_level : float

Readmission
  reason_infection : bool
  reason_complication : bool
  reason_pain_management : bool
  days_since_discharge : int

Full_recovery
  total_recovery_days : int
  patient_satisfaction : float
```

**Use Case:**
Hospitals can predict post-surgical outcomes to optimize care pathways and resource allocation.

**Example Predictions:**
- After cardiac surgery, predict probability of infection (15%), normal recovery (70%), or complications requiring intervention (15%)
- Each outcome includes specific data like severity scores, timeline, and required interventions

**Clinical Value:**
- Proactive resource allocation based on predicted complications
- Personalized recovery timelines for patient communication
- Early intervention triggers based on risk patterns

## Consumer Pricing & E-commerce

### Dynamic Pricing Optimization

**Event Types:**
```
View_product
  time_spent_seconds : float
  price_at_view : float
  discount_percentage : float

Add_to_cart
  quantity : int
  cart_total_value : float

Price_change_response
  old_price : float
  new_price : float
  time_since_last_view_hours : float

Purchase
  final_price : float
  payment_method : enum
  shipping_option : enum

Abandon_cart
  reason_price : bool
  reason_shipping : bool
  reason_comparison_shopping : bool
  items_in_cart : int

Return_item
  days_since_purchase : int
  return_reason : enum
  refund_amount : float
```

**Use Case:**
E-commerce platforms can optimize pricing strategies by predicting how price changes affect purchase probability for individual users.

**Example Analysis:**
- 10% price reduction increases purchase probability from 15% to 35% for price-sensitive users
- Premium users show 5% purchase probability decrease when offered discounts (perceived quality concern)
- Cart abandonment probability increases 40% when shipping costs exceed 8% of item value

## Quantitative Trading

### Market Event Prediction

**Event Types:**
```
CEO_change
  new_ceo_experience_years : int
  internal_promotion : bool
  industry_background_match : bool

Earnings_announcement
  eps_vs_estimate : float
  revenue_vs_estimate : float
  guidance_change : enum

Stock_price_movement
  price_change_percentage : float
  volume_change_percentage : float
  time_to_movement_hours : float

Acquisition_rumor
  rumor_credibility_score : float
  potential_premium_percentage : float
  market_reaction_immediate : float
```

**Use Case:**
Hedge funds can predict market reactions to corporate events and optimize trading strategies.

**Example Predictions:**
- CEO change with external hire: 65% probability of negative price movement (-3.2%), 35% probability of positive movement (+1.8%)
- Earnings beat by 15%: 80% probability of price increase (+5.1%) within 24 hours
