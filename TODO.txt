can't pass in arrays yet, but i can write something to handle that



Use the example that i provided in the data generation outline,
and check that the accuracy is the same as this.




can you make the trantion matrix deterministic, 
can you make the context length of the transformers 2 ?
can you make a bunch of sequences with different inital states?






Need to demoonstate how transfer learning is important
