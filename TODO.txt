#### Multi-Head Prediction System
The model employs specialized output heads for each component:

1. **Outcome Probability Head**
   - Softmax layer over all possible outcome types
   - Ensures probabilities sum to 1.0 across all outcomes
   - Handles dynamic outcome vocabularies

2. **Timing Prediction Head**
   - Regression head for each outcome type
   - Predicts relative time until event occurrence
   - Can use different time units (minutes, hours, days)

3. **Outcome Data Heads**
   - Separate prediction heads for each outcome type's data structure
   - **Numerical features**: Regression outputs
   - **Categorical features**: Classification outputs
   - **Boolean features**: Sigmoid activation
   - **Mixed-type features**: Hybrid prediction heads
