demo 3 needs to use Event , i am not sure it is working correcly



What the fuck is the new result and 
prepare_data is doing some strange stuff to the data like setting to 0






i've made some demos of a library that i want to develop which is used to model event sequences with event context. I'll provide you the demos, can you tell me how i can make this into a more general framework where i can pass in 1) what RNN network i want to use ie a transformer or a lstm and 2) The sequence data. The library should handle 







can't pass in arrays yet, but i can write something to handle that



Use the example that i provided in the data generation outline,
and check that the accuracy is the same as this.




can you make the trantion matrix deterministic, 
can you make the context length of the transformers 2 ?
can you make a bunch of sequences with different inital states?






Need to demoonstate how transfer learning is important
