Can you try to give me an example of data generation which is hard to visualise with simple tools like plots because it is sequence dependent, 
but also a simple sequence model cannot capture the entire relationship if it doesn't also contain data inside each sequence entry. 
For example, company price is impacted by ordered discrete events like hiring a new CEO, and the values related to these events might correlate to stock prices. 
For example the proportion of the board which voted in the new CEO. 
Give me python code which cannot be modelled easily by either system, 1 simple visualisation of values, 2 sequence with no values modelling. 
Make the example about stock price.


This data should have the property where

  Sequence data, 
  for example 
  [Product_Launch, CEO_Change, Earnings_Report, Competitor_Action, Product_Launch, ...],
  after being trained on will not generalised to validation data.
  This will be because sequence data is dependent on data inside each event in the sequence.

  And in the other way.
  Event data will not be able to be predicted accuratly without seqeunce data.


The purpose of this library is to build a library which can easily create a model which can fit data with this bi-directional relationship.
This is meant to generate data which will have lower performance for using a combination of models which do not see the interactions between the sequence and event data.


The multi head model should have a head for each outcome it is predicting.
The data should be created in a way that the multi head model cannot take advantage of transfer learning, and so should have lower performance.


when creating plots for model performance,
you should plot the training and validation performance at each time step to watch for overfitting.
