Can you try to give me an example of data generation which is hard to visualise with simple tools like plots because it is sequence dependent, 
but also a simple sequence model cannot capture the entire relationship if it doesn't also contain data inside each sequence entry. 
For example, company price is impacted by ordered discrete events like hiring a new CEO, and the values related to these events might correlate to stock prices. 
For example the proportion of the board which voted in the new CEO. 
Give me python code which cannot be modelled easily by either system, 1 simple visualisation of values, 2 sequence with no values modelling. 
Make the example about stock price.
